However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months. To protect the Company foreign currency denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of June 29, 2024, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt related foreign currency transactions is 18 years. The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. For example, statements in this Form 10-Q regarding the potential future impact of macroeconomic conditions on the Company business and results of operations are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can also be identified by words such as future, anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, intends, plans, predicts, will, would, could, can, may, and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the Company actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K and Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q, in each case under the heading Risk Factors. The Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law. Unless otherwise stated, all information presented herein is based on the Company fiscal calendar, and references to particular years, quarters, months or periods refer to the Company fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

The information contained on the websites referenced in this Form 10-Q is not incorporated by reference into this filing. Further, the Company references to website URLs are intended to be inactive textual references only. Business Seasonality and Product Introductions The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following product launch, and channel inventory of an older product often declines as the launch of newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate product introduction. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company announced the following product and operating system updates iPad Air iPad Pro iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, iPadOS 18, watchOS 11, visionOS 2 and tvOS 18.

Apple Intelligence is deeply integrated into iOS 18, macOS Sequoia and iPadOS 18. Fiscal Period The Company fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first quarter of 2023. The Company fiscal years 2024 and 2023 span 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and currency fluctuations, have directly and indirectly impacted, and could in the future materially impact, the Company results of operations and financial condition.
