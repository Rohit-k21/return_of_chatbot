It was seventy-five degrees in Phoenix, the sky perfect, cloudless blue. was wearing my favorite shirt sleeveless, white eyelet lace was wearing it as farewell gesture. My carry-on item was parka. In the Olympic Peninsula of northwest Washington State, small town named Forks exists under near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the United States of America. It was from this town and its gloomy, omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when was only few months old. It was in this town that d been compelled to spend month every summer until was fourteen. That was the year finally put my foot down these past three summers, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead.

He seemed genuinely pleased that was coming to live with him for the first time with any degree of permanence. He already gotten me registered for high school and was going to help me get car. But it was sure to be awkward with Charlie.

Well, now, you re welcome, he mumbled, embarrassed by my thanks. We exchanged few more comments on the weather, which was wet, and that was pretty much it for Conversation. We stared out the windows in silence. It was beautiful, of course couldn deny that. Everything was green the trees, their trunks covered with moss, their branches hanging with canopy of it, the ground covered with ferns. Even the air filtered down greenly through the leaves.

The desk now held secondhand computer, with the phone line for the modem stapled along the floor to the nearest phone jack. This was stipulation from my mother, so that we could stay in touch easily. The rocking chair from my baby days was still in the corner.

Charlie left first, off to the police station that was his wife and family. After he left, sat at the old square oak table in one of the three unmatching chairs and examined his small kitchen, with its dark paneled walls, bright yellow cabinets, and white linoleum floor. Nothing was changed. My mother had painted the cabinets eighteen years ago in an attempt to bring some sunshine into the house.

The engine started quickly, to my relief, but loudly, roaring to life and then idling at top volume. Well, truck this old was bound to have flaw. The antique radio worked, plus that hadn expected. Finding the school wasn difficult, though d never been there before. The school was, like most other things, just off the highway. It was not obvious that it was school only the sign, which declared it to be the Forks High School, made me stop. It looked like collection of matching houses, built with maroon- colored bricks. There were so many trees and shrubs couldn see its size at first. Where was the feel of the institution wondered nostalgically.

Inside, it was brightly lit, and warmer than d hoped. The office was small little waiting area with padded folding chairs, orange-flecked commercial carpet, notices and awards cluttering the walls, big clock ticking loudly. Plants grew everywhere in large plastic pots, as if there wasn enough greenery outside. The room was cut in half by long counter, cluttered with wire baskets full of papers and brightly colored flyers taped to its front. There were three desks behind the counter, one of which was manned by large, red-haired woman wearing glasses. She was wearing purple t-shirt, which immediately made me feel overdressed.",

The boy from English, Eric, waved at me from across the room. It was there, sitting in the lunchroom, trying to make conversation with seven curious strangers, that first saw them. They were sitting in the corner of the cafeteria, as far away from where sat as possible in the long room. There were five of them. They weren talking, and they weren eating, though they each had tray of untouched food in front of them. They weren gawking at me, unlike most of the other students, so it was safe to stare at them without fear of meeting an excessively interested pair of eyes. But it was none of these things that caught, and held, my attention. They didn look anything alike. Of the three boys, one was big muscled like serious weight lifter, with dark, curly hair.

The tall one was statuesque. She had beautiful figure, the kind you saw on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, the kind that made every girl around her take hit on her self-esteem just by being in the same room. Her hair was golden, gently waving to the middle of her back. The short girl was pixielike, thin in the extreme, with small features. Her hair was deep black, cropped short and pointing in every direction. And yet, they were all exactly alike. Every one of them was chalky pale, the palest of all the students living in this sunless town. Paler than me, the albino. They all had very dark eyes despite the range in hair tones. They also had dark shadows under those eyes purplish, bruiselike shadows. As if they were all suffering from sleepless night, or almost done recovering from broken nose. Though their noses, all their features, were straight, perfect, angular. But all this is not why couldn look away. stared because their faces, so different, so similar, were all devastatingly, inhumanly beautiful. They were faces you never expected to see except perhaps on the airbrushed pages of fashion magazine. Or painted by an old master as the face of an angel. It was hard to decide who was the most beautiful maybe the perfect blond girl, or the bronze-haired boy. They were all looking away away from each other, away from the other students, away from anything in particular as far as could tell. As watched, the small girl rose with her tray unopened soda, unbitten apple and walked away with quick, graceful lope that belonged on runway. watched, amazed at her lithe dancer step, till she dumped her tray and glided through the back door, faster than would have thought possible.

As she looked up to see who meant though already knowing, probably, from my tone suddenly he looked at her, the thinner one, the boyish one, the youngest, perhaps. He looked at my neighbor for just fraction of second, and then his dark eyes flickered to mine. He looked away quickly, more quickly than could, though in flush of embarrassment dropped my eyes at once. In that brief flash of glance, his face held nothing of interest it was as if she had called his name, and he looked up in involuntary response, already having decided not to answer. My neighbor giggled in embarrassment, looking at the table like did. That Edward and Emmett Cullen, and Rosalie and Jasper Hale. The one who left was Alice Cullen they all live together with Dr. Cullen and his wife. She said this under her breath. glanced sideways at the beautiful boy, who was looking at his tray now, picking bagel to pieces with long, pale fingers. His mouth was moving very quickly, his perfect lips barely opening. The other three still looked away, and yet felt he was speaking quietly to them. Strange, unpopular names, thought. The kinds of names grandparents had. But maybe that was in vogue here small town names finally remembered that my neighbor was called Jessica, perfectly common name. There were two girls named Jessica in my History class back home. They are very nice-looking. struggled with the conspicuous understatement. Yes Jessica agreed with another giggle. They re all together though Emmett and Rosalie, and Jasper and Alice, mean. And they live together. Her voice held all the shock and condemnation of the small town, thought critically.",

Dr. Cullen is really young, in his twenties or early thirties. They re all adopted. The Hales are brother and sister, twins the blondes and they re foster children. They look little old for foster children. They are now, Jasper and Rosalie are both eighteen, but they ve been with Mrs. Cullen since they were eight. She their aunt or something like that. That really kind of nice for them to take care of all those kids like that, when they re so young and everything. guess so, Jessica admitted reluctantly, and got the impression that she didn like the doctor and his wife for some reason. With the glances she was throwing at their adopted children, would presume the reason was jealousy. think that Mrs. Cullen can have any kids, though, she added, as if that lessened their kindness. Throughout all this conversation, my eyes flickered again and again to the table where the strange family sat. They continued to look at the walls and not eat. Have they always lived in Forks asked. Surely would have noticed them on one of my summers here. No, she said in voice that implied it should be obvious, even to new arrival like me. They just moved down two years ago from somewhere in Alaska. felt surge of pity, and relief. Pity because, as beautiful as they were, they were outsiders, clearly not accepted.

When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at black-topped lab table exactly like the ones was used to. She already had neighbor. In fact, all the tables were filled but one.

It seemed an innocent enough odor. let my hair fall over my right shoulder, making dark curtain between us, and tried to pay attention to the teacher.

During the whole class, he never relaxed his stiff position on the edge of his chair, sitting as far from me as possible. could see his hand on his left leg was clenched into fist, tendons standing out under his pale skin. This, too, he never relaxed. He had the long sleeves of his white shirt pushed up to his elbows, and his forearm was surprisingly hard and muscular beneath his light skin.

The girl who came in merely stepped to the desk, placed note in the wire basket, and walked out again. But Edward Cullen back stiffened, and he turned slowly to glare at me his face was absurdly handsome with piercing, hate-filled eyes.

It was miserable because had to play volleyball, and the one time didn cringe out of the way of the ball, hit my teammate in the head with it. And it was worse because Edward Cullen wasn in school at all. All morning was dreading lunch, fearing his bizarre glares. Part of me wanted to confront him and demand to know what his problem was.

With their remarkable good looks, the style with which they carried themselves, they could have worn dishrags and pulled it off. It seemed excessive for them to have both looks and money. But as far as could tell, life worked that way most of the time. It didn look as if it bought them any acceptance here. No, didn fully believe that. The isolation must be their desire couldn imagine any door that wouldn be opened by that degree of beauty.

He hung up his gun belt and stepped out of his boots as bustled about the kitchen. As far as was aware, he never shot the gun on the job. But he kept it ready. When came here as child, he would always remove the bullets as soon as he walked in the door. guess he considered me old enough now not to shoot myself by accident, and not depressed enough to shoot myself on purpose. What for dinner he asked warily. My mother was an imaginative cook, and her experiments weren always edible. was surprised, and sad, that he seemed to remember that far back. Steak and potatoes, answered, and he looked relieved. He seemed to feel awkward standing in the kitchen doing nothing he lumbered into the living room to watch TV while worked. We were both more comfortable that way. made salad while the steaks cooked, and set the table. called him in when dinner was ready, and he sniffed appreciatively as he walked into the room.

Dr. Cullen a great man. They the kids are little different. They don seem to fit in very well at school. Charlie surprised me by looking angry. People in this town, he muttered. Dr. Cullen is brilliant surgeon who could probably work in any hospital in the world, make ten times the salary he gets here, he continued, getting louder. We re lucky to have him lucky that his wife wanted to live in small town.

Beaches should be hot and dry. By Friday was perfectly comfortable entering my Biology class, no longer worried that Edward would be there.

    "page_37": "My first weekend in Forks passed without incident. Charlie, unused to spending time in the usually empty house, worked most of the weekend. cleaned the house, got ahead on my homework, and wrote my mom more bogusly cheerful e- mail. did drive to the library Saturday, but it was so poorly stocked that didn bother to get card would have to make date to visit Olympia or Seattle soon and find good bookstore. wondered idly what kind of gas mileage the truck got and shuddered at the thought. The rain stayed soft over the weekend, quiet, so was able to sleep well. People greeted me in the parking lot Monday morning. didn know all their names, but waved back and smiled at everyone. It was colder this morning, but happily not raining. In English, Mike took his accustomed seat by my side. We had pop quiz on Wuthering Heights. It was straightforward, very easy. All in all, was feeling lot more comfortable than had thought would feel by this point. More comfortable than had ever expected to feel here. When we walked out of class, the air was full of swirling bits of white. could hear people shouting excitedly to each other. The wind bit at my cheeks, my nose. Wow, Mike said. It snowing. looked at the little cotton fluffs that were building up along the sidewalk and swirling erratically past my face. Ew. Snow. There went my good day. He looked surprised. Don you like snow No. That means it too cold for rain. Obviously. Besides, thought it was supposed to come down in flakes you know, each one unique and all that.

He bent over and began scraping together pile of the white mush. ll see you at lunch, okay kept walking as spoke. Once people start throwing wet stuff, go inside. He just nodded, his eyes on Eric retreating figure. Throughout the morning, everyone chattered excitedly about the snow apparently it was the first snowfall of the new year. kept my mouth shut. Sure, it was drier than rain until it melted in your socks. walked alertly to the cafeteria with Jessica after Spanish. Mush balls were flying everywhere. kept binder in my hands, ready to use it as shield if necessary. Jessica thought was hilarious, but something in my expression kept her from lobbing snowball at me herself. Mike caught up to us as we walked in the doors, laughing, with ice melting the spikes in his hair. He and Jessica were talking animatedly about the snow fight as we got in line to buy food. glanced toward that table in the corner out of habit. And then froze where stood. There were five people at the table. Jessica pulled on my arm.

Actually, feel little sick, said, my eyes still on the floor. waited for them to get their food, and then followed them to table, my eyes on my feet. sipped my soda slowly, my stomach churning. Twice Mike asked, with unnecessary concern, how was feeling. told him it was nothing, but was wondering if should play it up and escape to the nurse office for the next hour. Ridiculous. shouldn have to run away. decided to permit myself one glance at the Cullen family table. If he was glaring at me, would skip Biology, like the coward was. kept my head down and glanced up under my lashes. None of them were looking this way. lifted my head little. They were laughing. Edward, Jasper, and Emmett all had their hair entirely saturated with melting snow. Alice and Rosalie were leaning away as Emmett shook his dripping hair toward them. They were enjoying the snowy day, just like everyone else only they looked more like scene from movie than the rest of us. But, aside from the laughter and playfulness, there was something different, and couldn quite pinpoint what that difference was. examined Edward the most carefully. His skin was less pale, decided flushed from the snow fight maybe the circles under his eyes much less noticeable. But there was something more. pondered, staring, trying to isolate the change.",

At that precise moment, his eyes flashed over to meet mine. dropped my head, letting my hair fall to conceal my face. was sure, though, in the instant our eyes met, that he didn look harsh or unfriendly as he had the last time d seen him. He looked merely curious again, unsatisfied in some way. Edward Cullen is staring at you, Jessica giggled in my ear. He doesn look angry, does he couldn help asking. No, she said, sounding confused by my question. Should he be don think he likes me, confided. still felt queasy. put my head down on my arm.

She snickered, but she looked away. raised my head enough to make sure that she did, contemplating violence if she resisted.

He let it drop. looked away awkwardly. Thankfully, Mr. Banner started class at that moment. tried to concentrate as he explained the lab we would be doing today. The slides in the box were out of order. Working as lab partners, we had to separate the slides of onion root tip cells into the phases of mitosis they represented and label them accordingly. We weren supposed to use our books. In twenty minutes, he would be coming around to see who had it right. Get started, he commanded.

However, he continued to reach for the microscope. watched him, still staggered, as he examined the slide for an even shorter time than had. Prophase, he agreed, writing it neatly in the first space on our worksheet. He swiftly switched out the first slide for the second, and then glanced at it cursorily. Anaphase, he murmured, writing it down as he spoke. kept my voice indifferent. May He smirked and pushed the microscope to me. looked through the eyepiece eagerly, only to be disappointed.

No. Oh, mumbled. thought there was something different about your eyes. He shrugged, and looked away. In fact, was sure there was something different. vividly remembered the flat black color of his eyes the last time he glared at me the color was striking against the background of his pale skin and his auburn hair. Today, his eyes were completely different color strange ocher, darker than butterscotch, but with the same golden tone. didn understand how that could be, unless he was lying for some reason about the contacts.

Not really, answered honestly, instead of pretending to be normal like everyone else. was still trying to dislodge the stupid feeling of suspicion, and couldn concentrate. You don like the cold. It wasn a question. Or the wet. Forks must be difficult place for you to live, he mused. You have no idea, muttered darkly. He looked fascinated by what said, for some reason couldn imagine.

He seemed engrossed in our conversation, but now could see, from the corner of my eye, that he was leaning away from me again, his hands gripping the edge of the table with unmistakable tension. tried to appear attentive as Mr. Banner illustrated, with transparencies on the overhead projector, what had seen without difficulty through the microscope. But my thoughts were unmanageable. When the bell finally rang, Edward rushed as swiftly and as gracefully from the room as he had last Monday. And, like last Monday, stared after him in amazement. Mike skipped quickly to my side and picked up my books for me. imagined him with wagging tail. That was awful, he groaned. They all looked exactly the same.

Edward Cullen was leaning against the front door of the Volvo, three cars down from me, and staring intently in my direction. swiftly looked away and threw the truck into reverse, almost hitting rusty Toyota Corolla in my haste. Lucky for the Toyota, stomped on the brake in time. It was just the sort of car that my truck would make scrap metal of. took deep breath, still looking out the other side of my car, and cautiously pulled out again, with greater success. stared straight ahead as passed the Volvo, but from peripheral peek, would swear saw him laughing.",

Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way.

When got out of my truck at school, saw why d had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and walked to the back of the truck carefully holding the side for support to examine my tires. There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. wasn used to being taken care of, and Charlie unspoken concern caught me by surprise.",

It was high-pitched screech, and it was fast becoming painfully loud. looked up, startled. saw several things simultaneously. Nothing was moving in slow motion, the way it does in the movies. Instead, the adrenaline rush seemed to make my brain work much faster, and was able to absorb in clear detail several things at once. Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and was standing between them. didn even have time to close my eyes. Just before heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. was lying on the pavement behind the tan car d parked next to. But didn have chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again. low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to stop foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into deep dent in the side of the van body. Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the",

It was absolutely silent for one long second before the screaming began. In the abrupt bedlam, could hear more than one person shouting my name. But more clearly than all the yelling, could hear Edward Cullen low, frantic voice in my ear. Bella Are you all right m fine. My voice sounded strange. tried to sit up, and realized he was holding me against the side of his body in an iron grasp. Be careful, he warned as struggled. think you hit your head pretty hard. became aware of throbbing ache centered above my left ear. Ow, said, surprised. That what thought.

Edward vehemently refused his, and tried to do the same, but the traitor told them d hit my head and probably had concussion. almost died of humiliation when they put on the neck brace. It looked like the entire school was there, watching soberly as they loaded me in the back of the ambulance. Edward got to ride in the front. It was maddening. To make matters worse, Chief Swan arrived before they could get me safely away. Bella he yelled in panic when he recognized me on the stretcher. m completely fine, Char Dad, sighed. There nothing wrong with me. He turned to the closest EMT for second opinion. tuned him out to consider the jumble of inexplicable images churning chaotically in my head. When they lifted me away from the car, had seen the deep dent in the tan car bumper very distinct dent that fit the contours of Edward shoulders as if he had braced himself against the car with enough force to damage the metal frame And then there was his family, looking on from the distance, with expressions that ranged from disapproval to fury but held no hint of concern for their brother safety. tried to think of logical solution that could explain what had just seen solution that excluded the assumption that was insane.

There was another flurry of hospital personnel, another stretcher brought to the bed next to me. recognized Tyler Crowley from my Government class beneath the bloodstained bandages wrapped tightly around his head. Tyler looked hundred times worse than felt. But he was staring anxiously at me. Bella, m so sorry m fine, Tyler you look awful, are you all right As we spoke, nurses began unwinding his soiled bandages, exposing myriad of shallow slices all over his forehead and left cheek. He ignored me. thought was going to kill you was going too fast, and hit the ice wrong He winced as one nurse started dabbing at his face. Don worry about it you missed me.

My eyes flew open. Edward was standing at the foot of my bed, smirking. glared at him. It wasn easy it would have been more natural to ogle. Hey, Edward, m really sorry Tyler began. Edward lifted hand to stop him. No blood, no foul, he said, flashing his brilliant teeth. He moved to sit on the edge of Tyler bed, facing me. He smirked again. So, what the verdict he asked me. There nothing wrong with me at all, but they won let me go, complained. How come you aren strapped to gurney like the rest of us It all about who you know, he answered. But don worry, came to spring you. Then doctor walked around the corner, and my mouth fell open. He was young, he was blond and he was handsomer than any movie star d ever seen.

But come back if you feel dizzy or have trouble with your eyesight at all. Can I go back to school asked, imagining Charlie trying to be attentive. Maybe you should take it easy today. glanced at Edward. Does he get to go to school Someone has to spread the good news that we survived, Edward said smugly. Actually, Dr. Cullen corrected, most of the school seems to be in the waiting room. Oh no, moaned, covering my face with my hands. Dr. Cullen raised his eyebrows.

Lucky Edward happened to be standing next to me, amended with hard glance at the subject of my statement. Oh, well, yes, Dr. Cullen agreed, suddenly occupied with the papers in front of him. Then he looked away, at Tyler, and walked to the next bed. My intuition flickered the doctor was in on it. m afraid that you ll have to stay with us just little bit longer, he said to Tyler, and began checking his cuts. As soon as the doctor back was turned, moved to Edward side. Can talk to you for minute hissed under my breath. He took step back from me, his jaw suddenly clenched. Your father is waiting for you, he said through his teeth. glanced at Dr. Cullen and Tyler. d like to speak with you alone, if you don mind, pressed. He glared, and then turned his back and strode down the long room. nearly had to run to keep up. As soon as we turned the corner into short hallway, he spun around to face me.

He was staring at me incredulously. But his face was tense, defensive. You think lifted van off you His tone questioned my sanity, but it only made me more suspicious. It was like perfectly delivered line by skilled actor. merely nodded once, jaw tight. Nobody will believe that, you know. His voice held an edge of derision now. m not going to tell anybody. said each word slowly, carefully controlling my anger.",

It was like trying to stare down destroying angel. Why did you even bother asked frigidly. He paused, and for brief moment his stunning face was unexpectedly vulnerable. don know, he whispered. And then he turned his back on me and walked away. was so angry, it took me few minutes until could move. When could walk, made my way slowly to the exit at the end of the hallway. The waiting room was more unpleasant than d feared. It seemed like every face knew in Forks was there, staring at me. Charlie rushed to my side put up my hands.

It was huge relief the first time d ever felt that way to get into the cruiser. We drove in silence. was so wrapped up in my thoughts that barely knew Charlie was there. was positive that Edward defensive behavior in the hall was confirmation of the bizarre things still could hardly believe d witnessed. When we got to the house, Charlie finally spoke. Um you ll need to call Ren e. He hung his head, guilty. was appalled. You told Mom Sorry. slammed the cruiser door little harder than necessary on my way out. My mom was in hysterics, of course. had to tell her felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down.

And more than little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. wasn as eager to escape Forks as should be, as any normal, sane person would be. decided might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, drifted to sleep.",

INVITATIONS In my dream it was very dark, and what dim light there was seemed to be radiating from Edward skin. couldn see his face, just his back as he walked away from me, leaving me in the blackness. No matter how fast ran, couldn catch up to him no matter how loud called, he never turned. Troubled, woke in the middle of the night and couldn sleep again for what seemed like very long time. After that, he was in my dreams nearly every night, but always on the periphery, never within reach. The month that followed the accident was uneasy, tense, and, at first, embarrassing. To my dismay, found myself the center of attention for the rest of that week. Tyler Crowley was impossible, following me around, obsessed with making amends to me somehow. tried to convince him what wanted more than anything else was for him to forget all about it especially since nothing had actually happened to me but he remained insistent. He followed me between classes and sat at our now-crowded lunch table. Mike and Eric were even less friendly toward him than they were to each other, which made me worry that d gained another unwelcome fan. No one seemed concerned about Edward, though explained over and over that he was the hero how he had pulled me out of the way and had nearly been crushed, too. tried to be convincing.

With chagrin, realized the probable cause no one else was as aware of Edward as always was. No one else watched him the way did. How pitiful. Edward was never surrounded by crowds of curious bystanders eager for his firsthand account. People avoided him as usual. The Cullens and the Hales sat at the same table as always, not eating, talking only among themselves. None of them, especially Edward, glanced my way anymore. When he sat next to me in class, as far from me as the table would allow, he seemed totally unaware of my presence. Only now and then, when his fists would suddenly ball up skin stretched even whiter over the bones did wonder if he wasn quite as oblivious as he appeared. He wished he hadn pulled me from the path of Tyler van there was no other conclusion could come to. wanted very much to talk to him, and the day after the accident tried. The last time d seen him, outside the ER, we both been so furious. still was angry that he wouldn trust me with the truth, even though was keeping my part of the bargain flawlessly. But he had in fact saved my life, no matter how he done it. And, overnight, the heat of my anger faded into awed gratitude. He was already seated when got to Biology, looking straight ahead. sat down, expecting him to turn toward me. He showed no sign that he realized was there. Hello, Edward, said pleasantly, to show him was going to behave myself. He turned his head fraction toward me without meeting my gaze, nodded once, and then looked the other way.",

Despite my outright lies, the tenor of my e-mails alerted Ren to my depression, and she called few times, worried. tried to convince her it was just the weather that had me down. Mike, at least, was pleased by the obvious coolness between me and my lab partner. could see he been worried that Edward daring rescue might have impressed me, and he was relieved that it seemed to have the opposite effect. He grew more confident, sitting on the edge of my table to talk before Biology class started, ignoring Edward as completely as he ignored us. The snow washed away for good after that one dangerously icy day. Mike was disappointed he never gotten to stage his snowball fight, but pleased that the beach trip would soon be possible. The rain continued heavily, though, and the weeks passed. Jessica made me aware of another event looming on the horizon she called the first Tuesday of March to ask my permission to invite Mike to the girls choice spring dance in two weeks. Are you sure you don mind you weren planning to ask him she persisted when told her didn mind in the least. No, Jess, m not going, assured her. Dancing was glaringly outside my range of abilities. It will be really fun. Her attempt to convince me was halfhearted. suspected that Jessica enjoyed my inexplicable popularity more than my actual company.",

She was silent as she walked by my side between classes, and was afraid to ask her why. If Mike had turned her down, was the last person she would want to tell. My fears were strengthened during lunch when Jessica sat as far from Mike as possible, chatting animatedly with Eric. Mike was unusually quiet. Mike was still quiet as he walked me to class, the uncomfortable look on his face bad sign. But he didn broach the subject until was in my seat and he was perched on my desk. As always, was electrically aware of Edward sitting close enough to touch, as distant as if he were merely an invention of my imagination. So, Mike said, looking at the floor, Jessica asked me to the spring dance. That great. made my voice bright and enthusiastic. You ll have lot of fun with Jessica. Well He floundered as he examined my smile, clearly not happy with my response. told her had to think about it. Why would you do that let disapproval color my tone, though was relieved he hadn given her an absolute no. His face was bright red as he looked down again. Pity shook my resolve. was wondering if well, if you might be planning to ask me. paused for moment, hating the wave of guilt that swept through me.

Can you go some other weekend Sorry, no, said. So you shouldn make Jess wait any longer it rude. Yeah, you re right, he mumbled, and turned, dejected, to walk back to his seat. closed my eyes and pressed my fingers to my temples, trying to push the guilt and sympathy out of my head. Mr. Banner began talking. sighed and opened my eyes. And Edward was staring at me curiously, that same, familiar edge of frustration even more distinct now in his black eyes. stared back, surprised, expecting him to look quickly away. But instead he continued to gaze with probing intensity into my eyes. There was no question of me looking away. My hands started to shake.

It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only thin border of actual sand at the water edge, after which it grew into millions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from distance, but close up were every shade stone could be terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves. There was brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while seagulls and lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky. We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to ring of driftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Eric and the boy thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had teepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders. Have you ever seen driftwood fire Mike asked me. was sitting on one of the bone-colored benches the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting one of the smaller sticks with cigarette lighter.",

Pretty, isn it He lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his other side. She turned to him and claimed his attention. watched the strange blue and green flames crackle toward the sky. After half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was dilemma. On the one hand, loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since was child they were one of the only things ever looked forward to when had to come to Forks. On the other hand, d also fallen into them lot. Not big deal when you re seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward request that not fall into the ocean. Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn want to hike, and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before got up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me huge smile when he saw that was coming. The hike wasn too long, though hated to lose the sky in the woods.

The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return. was completely absorbed, except for one small part of my mind that wondered what Edward was doing now, and trying to imagine what he would be saying if he were here with me. Finally the boys were hungry, and got up stiffly to follow them back. tried to keep up better this time through the woods, so naturally fell few times. got some shallow scrapes on my palms, and the knees of my jeans were stained green, but it could have been worse. When we got back to First Beach, the group we left behind had multiplied. As we got closer we could see the shining, straight black hair and copper skin of the newcomers, teenagers from the reservation come to socialize. The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim share while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, noticed younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while boy who looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him. All caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob.",

She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And was thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in blur at times, with single images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind. knew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me. During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering second expedition to the tide pools. Mike with Jessica shadowing him headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went with them others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, was sitting alone on my driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson. few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with rubber band at the nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored his eyes were dark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just hint of childish roundness left around his chin.

Rachel and Rebecca, suddenly recalled. Charlie and Billy had thrown us together lot during my visits, to keep us busy while they fished. We were all too shy to make much progress as friends. Of course, d kicked up enough tantrums to end the fishing trips by the time was eleven. Are they here examined the girls at the ocean edge, wondering if would recognize them now. No. Jacob shook his head. Rachel got scholarship to Washington State, and Rebecca married Samoan surfer she lives in Hawaii now. Married. Wow. was stunned. The twins were only little over year older than was. So how do you like the truck he asked. love it. It runs great. Yeah, but it really slow, he laughed. was so relived when Charlie bought it.

You know Bella, Jacob Lauren asked in what imagined was an insolent tone from across the fire. We ve sort of known each other since was born, he laughed, smiling at me again. How nice. She didn sound like she thought it was nice at all, and her pale, fishy eyes narrowed. Bella, she called again, watching my face carefully, was just saying to Tyler that it was too bad none of the Cullens could come out today. Didn anyone think to invite them Her expression of concern was unconvincing. You mean Dr. Carlisle Cullen family the tall, older boy asked before could respond, much to Lauren irritation. He was really closer to man than boy, and his voice was very deep.",

Tyler, trying to win back her attention, asked Lauren opinion on CD he held. She was distracted. stared at the deep-voiced boy, taken aback, but he was looking away toward the dark forest behind us. He said that the Cullens didn come here, but his tone had implied something more that they weren allowed they were prohibited. His manner left strange impression on me, and tried to ignore it without success. Jacob interrupted my meditation. So is Forks driving you insane yet Oh, d say that an understatement. grimaced. He grinned understandingly. was still turning over the brief comment on the Cullens, and had sudden inspiration. It was stupid plan, but didn have any better ideas. hoped that young Jacob was as yet inexperienced around girls, so that he wouldn see through my sure-to-be-pitiful attempts at flirting. Do you want to walk down the beach with me asked, trying to imitate that way Edward had of looking up from underneath his eyelashes. It couldn have nearly the same effect, was sure, but Jacob jumped up willingly enough. As we walked north across the multihued stones toward the driftwood seawall, the clouds finally closed ranks across the sky, causing the sea to darken and the temperature to drop. shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my jacket.

Not too much, he admitted with frown. But when get my car finished can go up as much as want after get my license, he amended. Who was that other boy Lauren was talking to He seemed little old to be hanging out with us. purposefully lumped myself in with the youngsters, trying to make it clear that preferred Jacob. That Sam he nineteen, he informed me. What was that he was saying about the doctor family asked innocently. The Cullens Oh, they re not supposed to come onto the reservation. He looked away, out toward James Island, as he confirmed what d thought d heard in Sam voice. Why not He glanced back at me, biting his lip. Oops. m not supposed to say anything about that. Oh, won tell anyone, m just curious. tried to make my smile alluring, wondering if was laying it on too thick. He smiled back, though, looking allured.

Do you know any of our old stories, about where we came from the Quileutes, mean he began. Not really, admitted. Well, there are lots of legends, some of them claiming to date back to the Flood supposedly, the ancient Quileutes tied their canoes to the tops of the tallest trees on the mountain to survive like Noah and the ark. He smiled, to show me how little stock he put in the histories. Another legend claims that we descended from wolves and that the wolves are our brothers still. It against tribal law to kill them. Then there are the stories about the cold ones. His voice dropped little lower. The cold ones asked, not faking my intrigue now. Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land. He rolled his eyes. Your great-grandfather encouraged. He was tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf well, not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves. ",
    "page_116": " Werewolves have enemies Only one. stared at him earnestly, hoping to disguise my impatience as admiration. So you see, Jacob continued, the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to our territory during my great-grandfather time was different. They didn hunt the way others of their kind did they weren supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made truce with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn expose them to the pale-faces. He winked at me. If they weren dangerous, then why tried to understand, struggling not to let him see how seriously was considering his ghost story. There always risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they re civilized like this clan was. You never know when they might get too hungry to resist. He deliberately worked thick edge of menace into his tone. What do you mean, civilized They claimed that they didn hunt humans. They supposedly were somehow able to prey on animals instead. tried to keep my voice casual. So how does it fit in with the Cullens Are they like the cold ones your greatgrandfather met No. He paused dramatically. They are the same ones. He must have thought the expression on my face was fear inspired by his story. He smiled, pleased, and continued. There are more of them now, new female and new male, but the rest are the same.

Only two options seemed practical. The first was to take his advice to be smart, to avoid him as much as possible. To cancel our plans, to go back to ignoring him as far as was able.

His voice was guarded. noticed that he wore no jacket himself, just light gray knit V-neck shirt with long sleeves. Again, the fabric clung to his perfectly muscled chest. It was colossal tribute to his face that it kept my eyes away from his body. m not quite that delicate, said, but pulled the jacket onto my lap, pushing my arms through the too-long sleeves, curious to see if the scent could possibly be as good as remembered.

His face was unreadable as we drove into the school parking lot. Something occurred to me belatedly. Where the rest of your family asked more than glad to be alone with him, but remembering that his car was usually full. They took Rosalie car. He shrugged as he parked next to glossy red convertible with the top up. Ostentatious, isn it Um, wow, breathed. If she has that, why does she ride with you Like said, it ostentatious.

He paused to catch stray lock of hair that was escaping the twist on my neck and wound it back into place. My heart spluttered hyperactively. suppose you could say yes to the first if you don mind it easier than any other explanation. don mind, said in faint voice. And as for her other question well, ll be listening to hear the answer to that one myself.

How very inconvenient his little talent could be when it wasn saving my life. The fog had almost dissolved by the end of the second hour, but the day was still dark with low, oppressing clouds. smiled up at the sky. Edward was right, of course.

Won you want to tell your father that you re spending the day with me There was an undercurrent to his question that didn understand. With Charlie, less is always more. was definite about that. Where are we going, anyway The weather will be nice, so ll be staying out of the public eye and you can stay with me, if you like to. Again, he was leaving the choice up to me. And you ll show me what you meant, about the sun asked, excited by the idea of unraveling another of the unknowns. Yes. He smiled, and then paused.

Bears gasped, and he smirked. You know, bears are not in season, added sternly, to hide my shock. If you read carefully, the laws only cover hunting with weapons, he informed me.

Mr. Banner shoved the tape into the reluctant VCR and walked to the wall to turn off the lights. And then, as the room went black, was suddenly hyperaware that Edward was sitting less than an inch from me. was stunned by the unexpected electricity that flowed through me, amazed that it was possible to be more aware of him than already was. crazy impulse to reach over and touch him, to stroke his perfect face just once in the darkness, nearly overwhelmed me. crossed my arms tightly across my chest, my hands balling into fists. was losing my mind. The opening credits began, lighting the room by token amount.

Occasionally would permit myself quick glance in his direction, but he never seemed to relax, either. The overpowering craving to touch him also refused to fade, and crushed my fists safely against my ribs until my fingers were aching with the effort. breathed sigh of relief when Mr. Banner flicked the lights back on at the end of class, and stretched my arms out in front of me, flexing my stiff fingers.

He raised his hand, hesitant, conflict raging in his eyes, and then swiftly brushed the length of my cheekbone with his fingertips. His skin was as icy as ever, but the trail his fingers left on my skin was alarmingly warm like d been burned, but didn feel the pain of it yet.

But my worries were unnecessary. Edward was waiting, leaning casually against the side of the gym, his breathtaking face untroubled now. As walked to his side, felt peculiar sense of release. Hi, breathed, smiling hugely. Hello. His answering smile was brilliant. How was Gym My face fell tiny bit. Fine, lied. Really He was unconvinced.

And then he was gone, the car speeding down the street and disappearing around the corner before could even collect my thoughts. smiled as walked to the house. It was clear he was planning to see me tomorrow, if nothing else. That night Edward starred in my dreams, as usual. However, the climate of my unconsciousness had changed. It thrilled with the same electricity that had charged the afternoon, and tossed and turned restlessly, waking often. It was only in the early hours of the morning that finally sank into an exhausted, dreamless sleep. When woke was still tired, but edgy as well. pulled on my brown turtleneck and the inescapable jeans, sighing as daydreamed of spaghetti straps and shorts. Breakfast was the usual, quiet event expected. Charlie fried eggs for himself had my bowl of cereal. wondered if he had forgotten about this Saturday.

How ghastly it would be, thought, shuddering, if Charlie had even the slightest inkling of exactly what did like. Charlie left then, with goodbye wave, and went upstairs to brush my teeth and gather my books. When heard the cruiser pull away, could only wait few seconds before had to peek out of my window. The silver car was already there, waiting in Charlie spot on the driveway. bounded down the stairs and out the front door, wondering how long this bizarre routine would continue. never wanted it to end.

He was smiling, relaxed and, as usual, perfect and beautiful to an excruciating degree. Good morning. His voice was silky. How are you today His eyes roamed over my face, as if his question was something more than simple courtesy. Good, thank you. was always good much more than good when was near him. His gaze lingered on the circles under my eyes. You look tired. couldn sleep, confessed, automatically swinging my hair around my shoulder to provide some measure of cover.",

Brown he asked skeptically. Sure. Brown is warm. miss brown. Everything that supposed to be brown tree trunks, rocks, dirt is all covered up with squashy green stuff here, complained. He seemed fascinated by my little rant. He considered for moment, staring into my eyes. You re right, he decided, serious again. Brown is warm.

It was the same CD. examined the familiar cover art, keeping my eyes down. It continued like that for the rest of the day. While he walked me to English, when he met me after Spanish, all through the lunch hour, he questioned me relentlessly about every insignificant detail of my existence. Movies d liked and hated, the few places d been and the many places wanted to go, and books endlessly books. couldn remember the last time d talked so much. More often than not, felt self-conscious, certain must be boring him. But the absolute absorption of his face, and his never-ending stream of questions, compelled me to continue. Mostly his questions were easy, only very few triggering my easy blushes. But when did flush, it brought on whole new round of questions. Such as the time he asked my favorite gemstone, and blurted out topaz before thinking. He been flinging questions at me with such speed that felt like was taking one of those psychiatric tests where you answer with the first word that comes to mind. was sure he would have continued down whatever mental list he was following, except for the blush. My face reddened because, until very recently, my favorite gemstone was garnet. It was impossible, while staring back into his topaz eyes, not to remember the reason for the switch.

But his pause was very short. What kinds of flowers do you prefer he fired off. sighed in relief, and continued with the psychoanalysis. Biology was complication again. Edward had continued with his quizzing up until Mr. Banner entered the room, dragging the audiovisual frame again. As the teacher approached the light switch, noticed Edward slide his chair slightly farther away from mine. It didn help. As soon as the room was dark, there was the same electric spark, the same restless craving to stretch my hand across the short space and touch his cold skin, as yesterday. leaned forward on the table, resting my chin on my folded arms, my hidden fingers gripping the table edge as fought to ignore the irrational longing that unsettled me. didn look at him, afraid that if he was looking at me, it would only make self-control that much harder. sincerely tried to watch the movie, but at the end of the hour had no idea what d just seen. sighed in relief again when Mr. Banner turned the lights on, finally glancing at Edward he was looking at me, his eyes ambivalent.

But couldn concentrate on him. hurried to change afterward, ill at ease, knowing the faster moved, the sooner would be with Edward. The pressure made me more clumsy than usual, but eventually made it out the door, feeling the same release when saw him standing there, wide smile automatically spreading across my face. He smiled in reaction before launching into more cross-examination. His questions were different now, though, not as easily answered. He wanted to know what missed about home, insisting on descriptions of anything he wasn familiar with. We sat in front of Charlie house for hours, as the sky darkened and rain plummeted around us in sudden deluge. tried to describe impossible things like the scent of creosote bitter, slightly resinous, but still pleasant the high, keening sound of the cicadas in July, the feathery barrenness of the trees, the very size of the sky, extending white-blue from horizon to horizon, barely interrupted by the low mountains covered with purple volcanic rock. The hardest thing to explain was why it was so beautiful to me to justify beauty that didn depend on the sparse, spiny vegetation that often looked half dead, beauty that had more to do with the exposed shape of the land, with the shallow bowls of valleys between the craggy hills, and the way they held on to the sun. found myself using my hands as tried to describe it to him.

Not good, he muttered. What is it was surprised to see that his jaw was clenched, his eyes disturbed. He glanced at me for brief second. Another complication, he said glumly. He flung the door open in one swift movement, and then moved, almost cringed, swiftly away from me. The flash of headlights through the rain caught my attention as dark car pulled up to the curb just few feet away, facing us.

Hey, Bella, called familiar, husky voice from the driver side of the little black car. Jacob asked, squinting through the rain.

He asked about my birthdays, my grade school teachers, my childhood pets and had to admit that after killing three fish in row, d given up on the whole institution.

Too late to regret not packing the Victoria Secret silk pajamas my mother got me two birthdays ago, which still had the tags on them in drawer somewhere back home. rubbed the towel through my hair again, and then yanked the brush through it quickly. threw the towel in the hamper, flung my brush and toothpaste into my bag. Then dashed down the stairs so Charlie could see that was in my pajamas, with wet hair. Night, Dad. Night, Bella. He did look startled by my appearance. Maybe that would keep him from checking on me tonight. took the stairs two at time, trying to be quiet, and flew into my room, closing the door tightly behind me. Edward hadn moved fraction of an inch, carving of Adonis perched on my faded quilt. smiled, and his lips twitched, the statue coming to life.

He lifted my chin, examining my face. You look very warm, actually. He bent his face slowly to mine, laying his cool cheek against my skin. held perfectly still. Mmmmmm he breathed. It was very difficult, while he was touching me, to frame coherent question. It took me minute of scattered concentration to begin. It seems to be much easier for you, now, to be close to me.

We stared cautiously at each other for moment, and then, as his clenched jaw gradually relaxed, his expression became puzzled. Did do something wrong No the opposite. You re driving me crazy, explained. He considered that briefly, and when he spoke, he sounded pleased. Really triumphant smile slowly lit his face. Would you like round of applause asked sarcastically. He grinned. m just pleasantly surprised, he clarified.

It was unmarked, barely visible among the ferns. The forest encroached on both sides, leaving the road ahead only discernible for few meters as it twisted, serpentlike, around the ancient trees. And then, after few miles, there was some thinning of the woods, and we were suddenly in small meadow, or was it actually lawn The gloom of the forest didn relent, though, for there were six primordial cedars that shaded an entire acre with their vast sweep of branches. The trees held their protecting shadow right up to the walls of the house that rose among them, making obsolete the deep porch that wrapped around the first story. don know what had expected, but it definitely wasn this. The house was timeless, graceful, and probably hundred years old. It was painted soft, faded white, three stories tall, rectangular and well proportioned. The windows and doors were either part of the original structure or perfect restoration. My truck was the only car in sight. could hear the river close by, hidden in the obscurity of the forest. Wow.

The inside was even more surprising, less predictable, than the exterior. It was very bright, very open, and very large. This must have originally been several rooms, but the walls had been removed from most of the first floor to create one wide space. The back, south-facing wall had been entirely replaced with glass, and, beyond the shade of the cedars, the lawn stretched bare to the wide river. massive curving staircase dominated the west side of the room. The walls, the high-beamed ceiling, the wooden floors, and the thick carpets were all varying shades of white. Waiting to greet us, standing just to the left of the door, on raised portion of the floor by spectacular grand piano, were Edward parents. d seen Dr. Cullen before, of course, yet couldn help but be struck again by his youth, his outrageous perfection. At his side was Esme, assumed, the only one of the family d never seen before. She had the same pale, beautiful features as the rest of them. Something about her heart-shaped face, her billows of soft, caramel-colored hair, reminded me of the ing nues of the silent-movie era. She was small, slender, yet less angular, more rounded than the others. They were both dressed casually, in light colors that matched the inside of the house. They smiled in welcome, but made no move to approach us. Trying not to frighten me, guessed. Carlisle, Esme, Edward voice broke the short silence, this is Bella. You re very welcome, Bella. Carlisle step was measured, careful as he approached me. He raised his hand tentatively, and stepped forward to shake hands with him.",

Hey, Edward Alice called enthusiastically. She ran down the stairs, streak of black hair and white skin, coming to sudden and graceful stop in front of me. Carlisle and Esme shot warning glances at her, but liked it. It was natural for her, anyway. Hi, Bella Alice said, and she bounced forward to kiss my cheek. If Carlisle and Esme had looked cautious before, they now looked staggered. There was shock in my eyes, too, but was also very pleased that she seemed to approve of me so entirely. was startled to feel Edward stiffen at my side. glanced at his face, but his expression was unreadable. You do smell nice, never noticed before, she commented, to my extreme embarrassment. No one else seemed to know quite what to say, and then Jasper was there tall and leonine. feeling of ease spread through me, and was suddenly comfortable despite where was.

She was happy, absorbed she seemed like new, mysterious being to me then, someone outside the mom persona took for granted.

You just said showing off was rude, he objected. There are exceptions to every rule, she replied. d like to hear you play, volunteered. It settled then. Esme pushed him toward the piano. He pulled me along, sitting me on the bench beside him. He gave me long, exasperated look before he turned to the keys. And then his fingers flowed swiftly across the ivory, and the room was filled with composition so complex, so luxuriant, it was impossible to believe only one set of hands played. felt my chin drop, my mouth open in astonishment, and heard low chuckles behind me at my reaction. Edward looked at me casually, the music still surging around us without break, and winked. Do you like it You wrote this gasped, understanding. He nodded.

He trying to reason with Rosalie. What is it that upsets her wasn sure if wanted to know the answer. He sighed deeply. Rosalie struggles the most with with what we are. It hard for her to have someone on the outside know the truth. And she a little jealous. Rosalie is jealous of me asked incredulously. tried to imagine universe in which someone as breathtaking as Rosalie would have any possible reason to feel jealous of someone like me. You re human.

You noticed that, did you shrugged. Of course. He looked at me thoughtfully for few seconds before answering. He wanted to tell me some news he didn know if it was something would share with you.

Finally, rational response he murmured. was beginning to think you had no sense of self-preservation at all. let that one pass, looking away, my eyes wandering again around the spacious room.

He was more serious when he answered. It the one place we never have to hide. The song he was still playing, my song, drifted to an end, the final chords shifting to more melancholy key.

Then, so quickly couldn be positive that he really did, he put his finger to his mouth to taste it. looked at him questioningly, and he gazed back for long moment before he finally smiled. Do you want to see the rest of the house No coffins verified, the sarcasm in my voice not entirely masking the slight but genuine anxiety felt. He laughed, taking my hand, leading me away from the piano. No coffins, he promised. We walked up the massive staircase, my hand trailing along the satin-smooth rail. The long hall at the top of the stairs was paneled with honey-colored wood, the same as the floorboards. Rosalie and Emmett room Carlisle office Alice room He gestured as he led me past the doors. He would have continued, but stopped dead at the end of the hall, staring incredulously at the ornament hanging on the wall above my head. Edward chuckled at my bewildered expression. You can laugh, he said. It is sort of ironic. didn laugh. My hand raised automatically, one finger extended as if to touch the large wooden cross, its dark patina contrasting with the lighter tone of the wall. didn touch it, though was curious if the aged wood would feel as silky as it looked. It must be very old, guessed. He shrugged. Early sixteen-thirties, more or less. ",
    "page_300": "I looked away from the cross to stare at him. Why do you keep this here wondered. Nostalgia. It belonged to Carlisle father. He collected antiques suggested doubtfully. No. He carved this himself. It hung on the wall above the pulpit in the vicarage where he preached. wasn sure if my face betrayed my shock, but returned to gazing at the simple, ancient cross, just in case. quickly did the mental math the cross was over three hundred and seventy years old. The silence stretched on as struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of so many years. Are you all right He sounded worried. How old is Carlisle asked quietly, ignoring his question, still staring up. He just celebrated his three hundred and sixty-second birthday, Edward said. looked back at him, million questions in my eyes. He watched me carefully as he spoke. Carlisle was born in London, in the sixteen-forties, he believes. Time wasn marked as accurately then, for the common people anyway. It was just before Cromwell rule, though. kept my face composed, aware of his scrutiny as listened. It was easier if didn try to believe. He was the only son of an Anglican pastor. His mother died giving birth to him. His father was an intolerant man. As the Protestants came into power, he was enthusiastic in his persecution of Roman Catholics and other religions. He also believed very strongly in the reality of evil. He led hunts for witches, werewolves and vampires. grew very still at the word. m sure he noticed,",
    "page_301": "but he went on without pausing. They burned lot of innocent people of course the real creatures that he sought were not so easy to catch. When the pastor grew old, he placed his obedient son in charge of the raids. At first Carlisle was disappointment he was not quick to accuse, to see demons where they did not exist. But he was persistent, and more clever than his father. He actually discovered coven of true vampires that lived hidden in the sewers of the city, only coming out by night to hunt. In those days, when monsters were not just myths and legends, that was the way many lived. The people gathered their pitchforks and torches, of course his brief laugh was darker now and waited where Carlisle had seen the monsters exit into the street. Eventually one emerged. His voice was very quiet strained to catch the words. He must have been ancient, and weak with hunger. Carlisle heard him call out in Latin to the others when he caught the scent of the mob. He ran through the streets, and Carlisle he was twenty-three and very fast was in the lead of the pursuit. The creature could have easily outrun them, but Carlisle thinks he was too hungry, so he turned and attacked. He fell on Carlisle first, but the others were close behind, and he turned to defend himself. He killed two men, and made off with third, leaving Carlisle bleeding in the street. He paused. could sense he was editing something, keeping something from me. Carlisle knew what his father would do. The bodies would be burned anything infected by the monster must be destroyed. Carlisle acted instinctively to save his own life. He crawled away from the alley while the mob followed the fiend and his victim. He hid in cellar, buried himself in rotting potatoes for three days. It a miracle he was able to keep silent, to stay undiscovered.",
    "page_302": " It was over then, and he realized what he had become. m not sure what my face was revealing, but he suddenly broke off. How are you feeling he asked. m fine, assured him. And, though bit my lip in hesitation, he must have seen the curiosity burning in my eyes. He smiled. expect you have few more questions for me. few. His smile widened over his brilliant teeth. He started back down the hall, pulling me along by the hand. Come on, then, he encouraged. ll show you. ",
    "page_303": "16. CARLISLE He led me back to the room that he pointed out as Carlisle office. He paused outside the door for an instant. Come in, Carlisle voice invited. Edward opened the door to high-ceilinged room with tall, west-facing windows. The walls were paneled again, in darker wood where they were visible. Most of the wall space was taken up by towering bookshelves that reached high above my head and held more books than d ever seen outside library. Carlisle sat behind huge mahogany desk in leather chair. He was just placing bookmark in the pages of the thick volume he held. The room was how d always imagined college dean would look only Carlisle looked too young to fit the part. What can do for you he asked us pleasantly, rising from his seat. wanted to show Bella some of our history, Edward said. Well, your history, actually. We didn mean to disturb you, apologized. Not at all. Where are you going to start The Waggoner, Edward replied, placing one hand lightly on my shoulder and spinning me around to look back toward the door we just come through. Every",
    "page_304": "time he touched me, in even the most casual way, my heart had an audible reaction. It was more embarrassing with Carlisle there. The wall we faced now was different from the others. Instead of bookshelves, this wall was crowded with framed pictures of all sizes, some in vibrant colors, others dull monochromes. searched for some logic, some binding motif the collection had in common, but found nothing in my hasty examination. Edward pulled me toward the far left side, standing me in front of small square oil painting in plain wooden frame. This one did not stand out among the bigger and brighter pieces painted in varying tones of sepia, it depicted miniature city full of steeply slanted roofs, with thin spires atop few scattered towers. wide river filled the foreground, crossed by bridge covered with structures that looked like tiny cathedrals. London in the sixteen-fifties, Edward said. The London of my youth, Carlisle added, from few feet behind us. flinched hadn heard him approach. Edward squeezed my hand. Will you tell the story Edward asked. twisted little to see Carlisle reaction. He met my glance and smiled. would, he replied. But m actually running bit late. The hospital called this morning Dr. Snow is taking sick day. Besides, you know the stories as well as do, he added, grinning at Edward now. It was strange combination to absorb the everyday concerns of the town doctor stuck in the middle of discussion of his early days in seventeenth- century London. It was also unsettling to know that he spoke aloud only for my benefit. After another warm smile for me, Carlisle left the room.",
    "page_305": "I stared at the little picture of Carlisle hometown for long moment. What happened then finally asked, staring up at Edward, who was watching me. When he realized what had happened to him He glanced back to the paintings, and looked to see which image caught his interest now. It was larger landscape in dull fall colors an empty, shadowed meadow in forest, with craggy peak in the distance. When he knew what he had become, Edward said quietly, he rebelled against it. He tried to destroy himself. But that not easily done. How didn mean to say it aloud, but the word broke through my shock. He jumped from great heights, Edward told me, his voice impassive. He tried to drown himself in the ocean but he was young to the new life, and very strong. It is amazing that he was able to resist feeding while he was still so new. The instinct is more powerful then, it takes over everything. But he was so repelled by himself that he had the strength to try to kill himself with starvation. Is that possible My voice was faint. No, there are very few ways we can be killed. opened my mouth to ask, but he spoke before could. So he grew very hungry, and eventually weak. He strayed as far as he could from the human populace, recognizing that his willpower was weakening, too. For months he wandered by night, seeking the loneliest places, loathing himself. One night, herd of deer passed his hiding place. He was so wild with thirst that he attacked without thought. His strength returned and he realized there was an alternative to being the vile monster he feared. Had he not eaten venison in his former life Over the next months his new philosophy was born. He could exist without being demon. He found himself again.",
    "page_306": " He began to make better use of his time. He always been intelligent, eager to learn. Now he had unlimited time before him. He studied by night, planned by day. He swam to France and He swam to France People swim the Channel all the time, Bella, he reminded me patiently. That true, guess. It just sounded funny in that context. Go on. Swimming is easy for us Everything is easy for you, griped. He waited, his expression amused. won interrupt again, promise. He chuckled darkly, and finished his sentence. Because, technically, we don need to breathe. You No, no, you promised. He laughed, putting his cold finger lightly to my lips. Do you want to hear the story or not You can spring something like that on me, and then expect me not to say anything, mumbled against his finger. He lifted his hand, moving it to rest against my neck. The speed of my heart reacted to that, but persisted. You don have to breathe demanded. No, it not necessary. Just habit. He shrugged. How long can you go without breathing Indefinitely, suppose don know. It gets bit uncomfortable being without sense of smell. ",

His hand dropped to his side and he stood very still, his eyes intent on my face. The silence lengthened. His features were immobile as stone. What is it whispered, touching his frozen face. His face softened under my hand, and he sighed. keep waiting for it to happen. For what to happen know that at some point, something tell you or something you see is going to be too much. And then you ll run away from me, screaming as you go. He smiled half smile, but his eyes were serious. won stop you. want this to happen, because want you to be safe. And yet, want to be with you. The two desires are impossible to reconcile He trailed off, staring at my face. Waiting. m not running anywhere, promised. We ll see, he said, smiling again. frowned at him. So, go on Carlisle was swimming to France. He paused, getting back into his story. Reflexively, his eyes flickered to another picture the most colorful of them all, the most ornately framed, and the largest it was twice as wide as the door it hung next to. The canvas overflowed with bright figures in swirling robes, writhing around long pillars and off marbled balconies. couldn tell if it represented Greek mythology, or if the characters floating in the clouds above were meant to be biblical. Carlisle swam to France, and continued on through Europe, to the universities there. By night he studied music, science, medicine and found his calling, his penance, in that, in saving human lives. His expression became awed, almost reverent. can adequately describe the struggle it took Carlisle two centuries",

He finds great deal of peace there, at the hospital Edward stared off into space for long moment. Suddenly he seemed to recall his purpose. He tapped his finger against the huge painting in front of us. He was studying in Italy when he discovered the others there. They were much more civilized and educated than the wraiths of the London sewers. He touched comparatively sedate quartet of figures painted on the highest balcony, looking down calmly on the mayhem below them. examined the grouping carefully and realized, with startled laugh, that recognized the golden-haired man. Solimena was greatly inspired by Carlisle friends. He often painted them as gods, Edward chuckled. Aro, Marcus, Caius, he said, indicating the other three, two black-haired, one snowy-white. Nighttime patrons of the arts. What happened to them wondered aloud, my fingertip hovering centimeter from the figures on the canvas. They re still there. He shrugged. As they have been for who knows how many millennia. Carlisle stayed with them only for short time, just few decades. He greatly admired their civility, their refinement, but they persisted in trying to cure his aversion to his natural food source, as they called it. They tried to persuade him, and he tried to persuade them, to no avail. At that point, Carlisle decided to try the New World. He dreamed of finding others like himself. He was very lonely, you see. He didn find anyone for long time. But, as monsters became the stuff of fairy tales, he found he could interact with unsuspecting humans as if he were one of them. He began practicing medicine. But the companionship he craved evaded",

When he turned back to me, gentle angel smile lit his expression. And so we ve come full circle, he concluded. Have you always stayed with Carlisle, then wondered. Almost always. He put his hand lightly on my waist and pulled me with him as he walked through the door. stared back at the wall of pictures, wondering if would ever get to hear the other stories. Edward didn say any more as we walked down the hall, so asked, Almost He sighed, seeming reluctant to answer.

Maybe it none of my business, but don think that is such good idea. You re right, agreed. It is none of your business. He raised his graying eyebrows at my tone. You probably don know this, but the Cullen family has an unpleasant reputation on the reservation. Actually, did know that, informed him in hard voice. This surprised him. But that reputation couldn be deserved, could it Because the Cullens never set foot on the reservation, do they could see that my less than subtle reminder of the agreement that both bound and protected his tribe pulled him up short. That true, he acceded, his eyes guarded. You seem well informed about the Cullens. More informed than expected. stared him down. Maybe even better informed than you are.

Thanks, Billy. Just think about what you re doing, Bella, he urged. Okay, agreed quickly. He frowned. What meant to say was, don do what you re doing. looked into his eyes, filled with nothing but concern for me, and there was nothing could say.

Needing no more invitation than that, she launched into minute-by-minute account of the previous night. mmm and ahh at the right places, but it wasn easy to concentrate. Jessica, Mike, the dance, the school they all seemed strangely irrelevant at the moment. My eyes kept flashing to the window, trying to judge the degree of light behind the heavy clouds. Did you hear what said, Bella Jess asked, irritated. m sorry, what said, Mike kissed me Can you believe it That wonderful, Jess, said.

Charlie was enjoying his food. was wondering desperately how to fulfill my assignment, struggling to think of way to broach the subject. What did you do with yourself today he asked, snapping me out of my reverie. Well, this afternoon just hung out around the house Only the very recent part of this afternoon, actually. tried to keep my voice upbeat, but my stomach was hollow. And this morning was over at the Cullens . Charlie dropped his fork. Dr. Cullen place he asked in astonishment. pretended not to notice his reaction. Yeah. What were you doing there He hadn picked his fork back up. Well, sort of have date with Edward Cullen tonight, and he wanted to introduce me to his parents Dad It appeared that Charlie was having an aneurysm.

There were metal guards over the headlights and tail-lights, and four large spotlights attached to the crash bar. The hardtop was shiny red. Charlie let out low whistle. Wear your seat belts, he choked out. Edward followed me around to my side and opened the door. gauged the distance to the seat and prepared to jump for it. He sighed, and then lifted me in with one hand. hoped Charlie didn notice. As he went around to the driver side, at normal, human pace, tried to put on my seat belt. But there were too many buckles.

The rain was mere drizzle, slowing every second, the sky brighter through the clouds. Sorry, Bella, we have to go on foot from here. You know what ll just wait here.

Yes. struggled to concentrate. About hitting trees and getting sick. His nose drew line up the skin of my throat to the point of my chin. His cold breath tickled my skin. And now His lips whispered against my jaw. Trees, gasped. Motion sickness. He lifted his face to kiss my eyelids. Bella, you don really think would hit tree, do you No, but might. There was no confidence in my voice. He smelled an easy victory. He kissed slowly down my cheek, stopping just at the corner of my mouth. Would let tree hurt you His lips barely brushed against my trembling lower lip. No, breathed. knew there was second part to my brilliant defense, but couldn quite call it back. You see, he said, his lips moving against mine. There nothing to be afraid of, is there No, sighed, giving up. Then he took my face in his hands almost roughly, and kissed me in earnest, his unyielding lips moving against mine. There really was no excuse for my behavior. Obviously knew better by now.

You re indestructible, mumbled, trying to catch my breath. might have believed that before met you. Now let get out of here before do something really stupid, he growled. He threw me across his back as he had before, and could see the extra effort it took for him to be as gentle as he was. locked my legs around his waist and secured my arms in choke hold around his neck.

He led me few feet through the tall, wet ferns and draping moss, around massive hemlock tree, and we were there, on the edge of an enormous open field in the lap of the Olympic peaks. It was twice the size of any baseball stadium. could see the others all there Esme, Emmett, and Rosalie, sitting on bare outcropping of rock, were the closest to us, maybe hundred yards away. Much farther out could see Jasper and Alice, at least quarter of mile apart, appearing to throw something back and forth, but never saw any ball. It looked like Carlisle was marking bases, but could they really be that far apart When we came into view, the three on the rocks rose. Esme started toward us. Emmett followed after long look at Rosalie back Rosalie had risen gracefully and strode off toward the field without glance in our direction. My stomach quivered uneasily in response. Was that you we heard, Edward Esme asked as she approached. It sounded like bear choking, Emmett clarified. smiled hesitantly at Esme. That was him. Bella was being unintentionally funny, Edward explained, quickly settling the score. Alice had left her position and was running, or dancing, toward us. She hurtled to fluid stop at our feet. It time, she announced. As soon as she spoke, deep rumble of thunder shook the forest beyond us, and then crashed westward toward town. Eerie, isn it Emmett said with easy familiarity, winking at me. Let go. Alice reached for Emmett hand and they darted toward the oversized field she ran like gazelle. He was nearly as graceful and just as fast",
    "page_333": " yet Emmett could never be compared to gazelle. Are you ready for some ball Edward asked, his eyes eager, bright. tried to sound appropriately enthusiastic. Go team He snickered and, after mussing my hair, bounded off after the other two. His run was more aggressive, cheetah rather than gazelle, and he quickly overtook them. The grace and power took my breath away. Shall we go down Esme asked in her soft, melodic voice, and realized was staring openmouthed after him. quickly reassembled my expression and nodded. Esme kept few feet between us, and wondered if she was still being careful not to frighten me. She matched her stride to mine without seeming impatient at the pace. You don play with them asked shyly. No, prefer to referee like keeping them honest, she explained. Do they like to cheat, then Oh yes you should hear the arguments they get into Actually, hope you don t, you would think they were raised by pack of wolves. You sound like my mom, laughed, surprised. She laughed, too. Well, do think of them as my children in most ways. never could get over my mothering instincts did Edward tell you had lost child No, murmured, stunned, scrambling to understand what lifetime she was remembering. Yes, my first and only baby. He died just few days after he was born, the poor tiny thing, she sighed. It broke my heart that why jumped off the cliff, you know, she added matter-of-factly. Edward just said you f-fell, stammered.",

That why m so happy that he found you, dear. The endearment sounded very natural on her lips. He been the odd man out for far too long it hurt me to see him alone. You don mind, then asked, hesitant again. That m all wrong for him No. She was thoughtful. You re what he wants. It will work out, somehow, she said, though her forehead creased with worry. Another peal of thunder began. Esme stopped then apparently, we reached the edge of the field. It looked as if they had formed teams. Edward was far out in left field, Carlisle stood between the first and second bases, and Alice held the ball, positioned on the spot that must be the pitcher mound. Emmett was swinging an aluminum bat it whistled almost untraceably through the air. waited for him to approach home plate, but then realized, as he took his stance, that he was already there farther from the pitcher mound than would have thought possible. Jasper stood several feet behind him, catching for the other team. Of course, none of them had gloves. All right, Esme called in clear voice, which knew even Edward would hear, as far out as he was. Batter up. Alice stood straight, deceptively motionless. Her style seemed to be stealth rather than an intimidating windup. She held the ball in both hands at her waist, and then, like the strike of cobra, her right hand flicked out and the ball smacked into Jasper hand. Was that strike whispered to Esme. If they don hit it, it a strike, she told me. Jasper hurled the ball back to Alice waiting hand. She permitted herself brief",

The crack of impact was shattering, thunderous it echoed off the mountains immediately understood the necessity of the thunderstorm. The ball shot like meteor above the field, flying deep into the surrounding forest. Home run, murmured. Wait, Esme cautioned, listening intently, one hand raised. Emmett was blur around the bases, Carlisle shadowing him. realized Edward was missing. Out Esme cried in clear voice. stared in disbelief as Edward sprang from the fringe of the trees, ball in his upraised hand, his wide grin visible even to me. Emmett hits the hardest, Esme explained, but Edward runs the fastest. The inning continued before my incredulous eyes. It was impossible to keep up with the speed at which the ball flew, the rate at which their bodies raced around the field. learned the other reason they waited for thunderstorm to play when Jasper, trying to avoid Edward infallible fielding, hit ground ball toward Carlisle. Carlisle ran into the ball, and then raced Jasper to first base. When they collided, the sound was like the crash of two massive falling boulders. jumped up in concern, but they were somehow unscathed. Safe, Esme called in calm voice. Emmett team was up by one Rosalie managed to flit around the bases after tagging up on one of Emmett long flies when Edward caught the third out. He sprinted to my side, sparkling with excitement. What do you think he asked.",

And it sounds like you did so much of that before, he laughed. am little disappointed, teased. Why he asked, puzzled. Well, it would be nice if could find just one thing you didn do better than everyone else on the planet. He flashed his special crooked smile, leaving me breathless. m up, he said, heading for the plate. He played intelligently, keeping the ball low, out of the reach of Rosalie always-ready hand in the outfield, gaining two bases like lightning before Emmett could get the ball back in play. Carlisle knocked one so far out of the field with boom that hurt my ears that he and Edward both made it in. Alice slapped them dainty high fives. The score constantly changed as the game continued, and they razzed each other like any street ballplayers as they took turns with the lead. Occasionally Esme would call them to order. The thunder rumbled on, but we stayed dry, as Alice had predicted. Carlisle was up to bat, Edward catching, when Alice suddenly gasped. My eyes were on Edward, as usual, and saw his head snap up to look at her. Their eyes met and something flowed between them in an instant. He was at my side before the others could ask Alice what was wrong. Alice Esme voice was tense. didn see couldn tell, she whispered. All the others were gathered by this time.",
    "page_337": " What is it, Alice Carlisle asked with the calm voice of authority. They were traveling much quicker than thought. can see had the perspective wrong before, she murmured. Jasper leaned over her, his posture protective. What changed he asked. They heard us playing, and it changed their path, she said, contrite, as if she felt responsible for whatever had frightened her. Seven pairs of quick eyes flashed to my face and away. How soon Carlisle said, turning toward Edward. look of intense concentration crossed his face. Less than five minutes. They re running they want to play. He scowled. Can you make it Carlisle asked him, his eyes flicking toward me again. No, not carrying He cut short. Besides, the last thing we need is for them to catch the scent and start hunting. How many Emmett asked Alice. Three, she answered tersely. Three he scoffed. Let them come. The steel bands of muscle flexed along his massive arms. For split second that seemed much longer than it really was, Carlisle deliberated. Only Emmett seemed unperturbed the rest stared at Carlisle face with anxious eyes. Let just continue the game, Carlisle finally decided. His voice was cool and level. Alice said they were simply curious. All this was said in flurry of words that lasted only few seconds. had listened carefully and caught most of it, though couldn hear what Esme now asked Edward with silent vibration of her lips. only saw the slight shake of",

The others returned to the field, warily sweeping the dark forest with their sharp eyes. Alice and Esme seemed to orient themselves around where stood. Take your hair down, Edward said in low, even voice. obediently slid the rubber band out of my hair and shook it out around me. stated the obvious. The others are coming now. Yes, stay very still, keep quiet, and don move from my side, please. He hid the stress in his voice well, but could hear it. He pulled my long hair forward, around my face. That won help, Alice said softly. could smell her across the field. know. hint of frustration colored his tone. Carlisle stood at the plate, and the others joined the game halfheartedly. What did Esme ask you whispered. He hesitated for second before he answered. Whether they were thirsty, he muttered unwillingly. The seconds ticked by the game progressed with apathy now. No one dared to hit harder than bunt, and Emmett, Rosalie, and Jasper hovered in the infield. Now and again, despite the fear that numbed my brain, was aware of Rosalie eyes on me. They were expressionless, but something about the way she held her mouth made me think she was angry. Edward paid no attention to the game at all, eyes and mind ranging the forest. m sorry, Bella, he muttered fiercely. It was stupid, irresponsible, to expose you like this. m so sorry. ",
    "page_339": "I heard his breath stop, and his eyes zeroed in on right field. He took half step, angling himself between me and what was coming. Carlisle, Emmett, and the others turned in the same direction, hearing sounds of passage much too faint for my ears.",

The first male into the clearing fell back immediately, allowing the other male to take the front, orienting himself around the tall, dark-haired man in manner that clearly displayed who led the pack. The third was woman from this distance, all could see of her was that her hair was startling shade of red. They closed ranks before they continued cautiously toward Edward family, exhibiting the natural respect of troop of predators as it encounters larger, unfamiliar group of its own kind. As they approached, could see how different they were from the Cullens. Their walk was catlike, gait that seemed constantly on the edge of shifting into crouch. They dressed in the ordinary gear of backpackers jeans and casual button-down shirts in heavy, weatherproof fabrics. The clothes were frayed, though, with wear, and they were barefoot. Both men had cropped hair, but the woman brilliant orange hair was filled with leaves and debris from the woods. Their sharp eyes carefully took in the more polished, urbane stance of Carlisle, who, flanked by Emmett and Jasper, stepped guardedly forward to meet them. Without any seeming communication between them, they each straightened into more casual, erect bearing. The man in front was easily the most beautiful, his skin olive-toned beneath the typical pallor, his hair glossy black. He was of medium build, hard-muscled,",

The woman was wilder, her eyes shifting restlessly between the men facing her, and the loose grouping around me, her chaotic hair quivering in the slight breeze. Her posture was distinctly feline. The second male hovered unobtrusively behind them, slighter than the leader, his light brown hair and regular features both nondescript. His eyes, though completely still, somehow seemed the most vigilant. Their eyes were different, too. Not the gold or black had come to expect, but deep burgundy color that was disturbing and sinister. The dark-haired man, still smiling, stepped toward Carlisle. We thought we heard game, he said in relaxed voice with the slightest of French accents. m Laurent, these are Victoria and James. He gestured to the vampires beside him. m Carlisle. This is my family, Emmett and Jasper, Rosalie, Esme and Alice, Edward and Bella. He pointed us out in groups, deliberately not calling attention to individuals. felt shock when he said my name. Do you have room for few more players Laurent asked sociably. Carlisle matched Laurent friendly tone. Actually, we were just finishing up. But we certainly be interested another time. Are you planning to stay in the area for long We re headed north, in fact, but we were curious to see who was in the neighborhood. We haven run into any company in long time. No, this region is usually empty except for us and the occasional visitor, like yourselves. The tense atmosphere had slowly subsided into casual conversation guessed",
    "page_342": "that Jasper was using his peculiar gift to control the situation. What your hunting range Laurent casually inquired. Carlisle ignored the assumption behind the inquiry. The Olympic Range here, up and down the Coast Ranges on occasion. We keep permanent residence nearby. There another permanent settlement like ours up near Denali. Laurent rocked back on his heels slightly. Permanent How do you manage that There was honest curiosity in his voice. Why don you come back to our home with us and we can talk comfortably Carlisle invited. It a rather long story. James and Victoria exchanged surprised look at the mention of the word home, but Laurent controlled his expression better. That sounds very interesting, and welcome. His smile was genial. We ve been on the hunt all the way down from Ontario, and we haven had the chance to clean up in while. His eyes moved appreciatively over Carlisle refined appearance. Please don take offense, but we appreciate it if you refrain from hunting in this immediate area. We have to stay inconspicuous, you understand, Carlisle explained. Of course. Laurent nodded. We certainly won encroach on your territory. We just ate outside of Seattle, anyway, he laughed. shiver ran up my spine. We ll show you the way if you like to run with us Emmett and Alice, you can go with Edward and Bella to get the Jeep, he casually added. Three things seemed to happen simultaneously while Carlisle was speaking. My hair ruffled with the light breeze, Edward stiffened, and the second male, James, suddenly whipped his head around, scrutinizing me, his nostrils flaring.",
    "page_343": "A swift rigidity fell on all of them as James lurched one step forward into crouch. Edward bared his teeth, crouching in defense, feral snarl ripping from his throat. It was nothing like the playful sounds d heard from him this morning it was the single most menacing thing had ever heard, and chills ran from the crown of my head to the back of my heels. What this Laurent exclaimed in open surprise. Neither James nor Edward relaxed their aggressive poses. James feinted slightly to the side, and Edward shifted in response. She with us. Carlisle firm rebuff was directed toward James. Laurent seemed to catch my scent less powerfully than James, but awareness now dawned on his face. You brought snack he asked, his expression incredulous as he took an involuntary step forward. Edward snarled even more ferociously, harshly, his lip curling high above his glistening, bared teeth. Laurent stepped back again. said she with us, Carlisle corrected in hard voice. But she human, Laurent protested. The words were not at all aggressive, merely astounded. Yes. Emmett was very much in evidence at Carlisle side, his eyes on James. James slowly straightened out of his crouch, but his eyes never left me, his nostrils still wide. Edward stayed tensed like lion in front of me. When Laurent spoke, his tone was soothing trying to defuse the sudden hostility. It appears we have lot to learn about each other. Indeed. Carlisle voice was still cool.",
    "page_344": " But we like to accept your invitation. His eyes flicked toward me and back to Carlisle. And, of course, we will not harm the human girl. We won hunt in your range, as said. James glanced in disbelief and aggravation at Laurent and exchanged another brief look with Victoria, whose eyes still flickered edgily from face to face. Carlisle measured Laurent open expression for moment before he spoke. We ll show you the way. Jasper, Rosalie, Esme he called. They gathered together, blocking me from view as they converged. Alice was instantly at my side, and Emmett fell back slowly, his eyes locked on James as he backed toward us. Let go, Bella. Edward voice was low and bleak. This whole time d been rooted in place, terrified into absolute immobility. Edward had to grip my elbow and pull sharply to break my trance. Alice and Emmett were close behind us, hiding me. stumbled alongside Edward, still stunned with fear. couldn hear if the main group had left yet. Edward impatience was almost tangible as we moved at human speed to the forest edge. Once we were into the trees, Edward slung me over his back without breaking stride. gripped as tightly as possible as he took off, the others close on his heels. kept my head down, but my eyes, wide with fright, wouldn close. They plunged through the now-black forest like wraiths. The sense of exhilaration that usually seemed to possess Edward as he ran was completely absent, replaced by fury that consumed him and drove him still faster. Even with me on his back, the others trailed behind. We reached the Jeep in an impossibly short time, and Edward barely slowed as he flung me in the backseat. Strap her in, he ordered Emmett, who slid in beside me.",

Edward was growling something too fast for me to understand, but it sounded lot like string of profanities. The jolting trip was much worse this time, and the darkness only made it more frightening. Emmett and Alice both glared out the side windows. We hit the main road, and though our speed increased, could see much better where we were going. And we were headed south, away from Forks. Where are we going asked. No one answered. No one even looked at me. Dammit, Edward Where are you taking me We have to get you away from here far away now. He didn look back, his eyes on the road. The speedometer read hundred and five miles an hour. Turn around You have to take me home shouted. struggled with the stupid harness, tearing at the straps. Emmett, Edward said grimly.

So imagine things are going well if they can call. It means the tracker is close enough that they don want him to overhear. And Esme think she must be back in Forks.

She smiled wide, ominous smile. We have another fairly superfluous weapon. We re also venomous, she said, her teeth glistening. The venom doesn kill it merely incapacitating. It works slowly, spreading through the bloodstream, so that, once bitten, our prey is in too much physical pain to escape us. Mostly superfluous, as said. If we re that close, the prey doesn escape. Of course, there are always exceptions. Carlisle, for example. So if the venom is left to spread murmured. It takes few days for the transformation to be complete, depending on how much venom is in the bloodstream, how close the venom enters to the heart. As long as the heart keeps beating, the poison spreads, healing, changing the body as it moves through it. Eventually the heart stops, and the conversion is finished.
